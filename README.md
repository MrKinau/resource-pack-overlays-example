# Overlays Example Resource Pack
A simple example resource pack to demonstrate resource pack overlays, which are added in Minecraft 1.20.2 ([Changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/de-de/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-20-2))

This example only changes the pumpkin blur, you get with an equipped carved pumpkin. As configured in [pack.mcmeta](pack.mcmeta) you'll get another overlay containing a different pumpkinblur UI if the pack is loaded with pack version 18 (1.20.2).
